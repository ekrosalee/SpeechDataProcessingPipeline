Step 1. Retrieve speech data from the server

Open terminal.

Log into server computer:
ssh server address
e.g., ssh webexperiments@hjpatt-136.umd.edu

Type in password (nothing will appear when you type):
(type in server password)

Access the folder that contains your speech data
cd path/to/your_folder
e.g., cd Sites/Web_Experiments/Phillips/Rosa/uploads

Check that the folder contains your speech data
ls 

Go back to the main folder
cd .. 

Compress the folder containing speech files to zip:
zip -r name_of_zip ~/path/to/folder/containing/recording_files/
e.g., zip -r uploads.zip uploads/
→ compresses ‘uploads’ folder and name the zipped folder ‘uploads.zip’

Check that the zip file is created in the main folder:
ls 

Exit the server:
exit

Download the zip file from the server to your local computer (requires server password):
scp -r server_address:~/path/to/zip_in_the_server  ~/path/to/local_destination_folder
(type in server password)
e.g., scp -r webexperiments@hjpatt-136.umd.edu:Sites/Web_Experiments/Phillips/Rosa/recordings.zip ~/PlanetCloze/data/backup
→ downloads ‘recordings.zip’ to a local folder ‘backup’

Output of this section: a zip file containing speech files saved locally on your computer

Step 2. Convert .webm files into .wav files

Unzip all individual speech files using terminal:
cd path_to_folder
unzip \*.zip

Convert the .webm files into .wav files:
cd path_to_folder
for i in *.webm; do ffmpeg -i "$i" "${i%.*}.wav"; done

Rename the original folder to “webm_wav”

Make a new folder “wav” and copy-paste only the .wav files into the folder

(Upload folder to Google Drive)

Output of this section: a “wav” folder containing all speech files in .wav format
Supplementary Notes
Key terminal commands

To see a list of all files in a folder:
ls 

To see a list of all files in a folder, ordered (most recent files on top):
ls -1 -tr

To create a folder:
mkdir your_folder_name
e.g., mkdir recordings
→ creates a folder named ‘recordings’ in the location you are currently working in

To compress files in a folder:
zip -r name_of_zip ~/path/to/folder_containing_files/
e.g., zip -r uploads.zip uploads/ 
→ compresses ‘uploads’ folder and name the zipped folder ‘uploads.zip’

To unzip a folder:
unzip folder_name.zip -d ~/path/to/destination/name_of_unzipped_folder
e.g., unzip ‘uploads.zip -d ~/uploads_unzipped 
→ unzips ‘uploads’ folder and name the unzipped folder ‘uploads_unzipped’
To upload and download files to and from the server:

On your local computer:

To upload a local folder to the server:
scp -r ~/path/to/your/local/folder.zip webexperiments@hjpatt-136.umd.edu:~/path/to/your_folder_in_the_server
(It will require the server password. Type in password and press enter.)
e.g., scp -r ~/images.zip webexperiments@hjpatt-136.umd.edu:Sites/Web_Experiments/Phillips/Rosa/PlanetCloze/stims 
→ uploads ‘images.zip’ to the ‘stims’ folder on the server computer

To download files from the server to your local computer:
scp -r webexperiments@hjpatt-136.umd.edu:~/path/to/your_folder_in_the_server  ~/path/to/your/local_folder
(It will require the server password. Type in password and press enter.)
e.g., scp -r webexperiments@hjpatt-136.umd.edu:Sites/Web_Experiments/Phillips/Rosa/recordings.zip ~/PlanetCloze/data/backup 
→ downloads ‘recordings.zip’ to a local folder ‘backup’
