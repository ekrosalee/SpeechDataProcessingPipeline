# Speech Data Processing Pipeline
A pipeline for pre-processing speech data obtained from psycholinguistic experiments

Main steps:

1. Convert recordings into the correct format (.wav): _**prepare_speech_data.pdf**_
2. Transcribe: unzip & upload _**get_transcriptions.zip**_ to your Google Drive (under My Drive) and open _**get_transcriptions.ipynb**_ in Google Colab
3. Get timing measures
4. Manually check transcriptions and alignments
5. Export and analyze results
