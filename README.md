A pipeline for pre-processing speech data obtained from psycholinguistic experiments

Main steps:

1. Convert recordings into the correct format (.wav):  **prepare_speech_data.pdf**
2. Transcribe: 1) **get_transcriptions.ipynb**; 2) download and upload **your_folder_name.zip** to your Google Drive (under My Drive)
3. Get timing measures
4. Manually check transcriptions and alignments
5. Export and analyze results
